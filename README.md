**Teaching material:** https://elearning.uniparthenope.it/course/view.php?id=121 (access granted to students enrolled at the University of Naples "Parthenope".


The course is an introduction to programming applications in the internet environment with references to the use of mobile devices. The course introduces programming web applications using the LAMP platform (Linux, Apache, MongoDB, Python). Part of the course is devoted to an introduction to Cloud Computing, with particular reference to the services offered by Amazon Web Services for web technologies, and to the Internet of Things using Arduino or similar microcontrollers. During the lessons, continuous references are made to technologies for the development of mobile multi-platform hybrid applications, the management and representation of spatial data on the web, and distributed/wearable pervasive systems.

The course includes an introduction to the Python language, used for the development of software projects and hardware in the Laboratory activities (single or group) that are an integral part of the course. The course has a typically practical/applications setting, designed to solve concrete problems and develop software that is actually usable.

**Understanding skills:** The student must demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of web technologies, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things, with particular regard to complex and distributed web applications, web-based application development and analysis methodologies, Python programming language and its application context, processes, and software development techniques in this context.

**Applicative skills:** The student must demonstrate his / her knowledge acquired to solve computational problems such as web applications or mobile / embedded hybrid applications based on web technologies in concrete contexts, to develop design solutions and analyze them from the point of view of architecture and usability, and to consciously use one or more programming languages ​​to implement a complex web application. These capabilities also involve a thorough and aware use of the tools offered by cloud computing, the Internet of Things, and different application frameworks.

**Judgment autonomy:** The student must be able to independently evaluate the results of the application developed in both design and software implementation, assessing its effectiveness and efficiency.

**Communication skills:** The student must be able to draw up a project submission report and document its implementation, including working in a group, using advanced writing/documentation tools, with particular reference to the use of productivity tools for developers as systems for Shared Publishing (Google Drive), Remote Collaboration (Slack), Production Management (Trello), Online Repository Management (GitHub), Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (Amazon AWS) Using the Web Technology Terminology Correctly Also in English.

**Learning skills:** The student must be able to update and deepen autonomously specific web technology topics and applications, including accessing databases, online document repositories, software and application libraries, and other network resources.
